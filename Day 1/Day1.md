## Software Testing
It is part of Software development helps to 
- acheive quality assurance
- meet requirements
- produce Bug - free
- Not only for finding bug but also optimizing application.

> Note : Software testing is important as a small bug can lead to lot of money and life loss.

## Who conducts Software Testing

- Developer : Unit test
- Tester : functional and performance testing
- Test Managers/Lead/Architects : prepare testing plan / docs
- End User : User Acceptance testing

## Software testing types based on doing

- Manual Testing  : tester himself write all test case for unit,integration,system etc.,
- Automated Testing : tester uses automation tool like selenium.

## Software testing types 

- functional test : application running correctly
- non-functional test : application matches the requirement overall

## Software Testiing Types

- Requirement Design:	Acceptance test creation eg: e-commerce  login,regitser 
- Functional Specification: Functional test case creation eg: can add to cart
- Implementation :	Unit test case creation  eg : stored properly in database
- Code Complete :	Test case execution for entire application to check the work together.

## Quality Assurance

Quality (how well the application fit the intented function).
Assurance (giving confidence that the application will run excepted).It involves mostly process to attain the final product example checklist for preparing cake.(verification).

## Quality Control

Findind the defect or bugs in the final project and fixing it
Validating cake by eating it sample and fixing any changes.

[Reference for QA / QC](https://artoftesting.com/quality-assurance)


## Validation and Verification

Verification : are we building the product right?. For example we order a cake and verify it by seeing whether the color is same, toppings and smells good.

Like Code review, documents, design on a specific requirement.fixing is easy and low cost

Validation : are we build the right product. Eating cake to ensure it taste well

Checking where what we agree (customer requirement) and what er build are same and fixing here is costly and time consuming because we baked a cake with blueberry apperance but with velvet taste

## Principle of software Testing

1. Exhaustive test is not possible example: there are lot of test scenerio in moving a file from one directory to another.we can't test everything

1. Defect Clustering : We need to choose the module which will result in large defect. It come by experience

1. Pesticide paradox : we need to alter and review the test case periodically to identify defect in the application ( same pesticide in farm create immunity to insects)

1. Testing shows presence of defect : if testing doesn't give bugs or defect it doesn't mean that application is correct and bug free

1. Absence of error : if we work hard and test our application to 99% but the application doesn't meet requirement is useless

1. Early testing : start to test at the time of requirement itself.

1. Test is context dependent : changes project to project.
